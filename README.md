# TOC FINAL PROJECT: chatbot

## search Randy in telegram to find it

### usage:
1.	type '/menu' or simply type anything to see the menu of Randy.
2.	there are two modes of this bot. '/angry_randy' or '/scheduling'.
3.	'/angry_randy' is a mode that you can annoy Randy as much as you like, until it reaches the final state. Type in 'sorry' to calm Randy down, he'll be nice again.
4.	'/scheduling' is a mode that you can manage your schedule. Um....Well it's meant to be, but I don't have time to revise Randy into a very convenient schedule manager ;(
5.	You still can enter your schedule in the format <'schedule'-'time'>
	for example: buy groceries-9:15
	But Randy only shows you the schedule you entered so far, it won't remind you.
	So it's more like a "to do list bot" :|
